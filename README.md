# Spam-Classifier
Spam_Classifier1 : I've used Stemming and Bag of Words which gives me an accuracy of 98%.
Spam_Classifier1 : I've used Lemmatization and Bag of Words which gives me an accuracy of 98%.

When Lemmatization and TF-IDF (term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is used, it gives an accuracy of 97%.
When Stemming and TF-IDF (term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency) is used, it gives an accuracy of 96%.

Play around with the parameters and see how it responds.
